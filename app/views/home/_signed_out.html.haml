      Voters send a text or register online to request a ride, and Drive the Vote connects them with a volunteer driver, who picks them up and takes them to their polling place.
    
    Drive the Vote is a ride-matching, dispatching, and monitoring app to help you get out the vote. We work with local partners, who use Drive the Vote to schedule rides either in advance or on-demand. They system then connects them with a volunteer driver, who picks them up and takes them to their polling place.
