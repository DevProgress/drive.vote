      Drive the Vote
    matches people who need a ride to their polling place with volunteer drivers, and provides notifications and information about voting times and polling places. It's non-partisan--anyone can use it.

    Many states allow #{link_to 'early voting', 'https://www.vote.org/early-voting-calendar/', target: '_blank'} and/or #{link_to 'absentee ballots', 'https://www.vote.org/absentee-ballot/', target: '_blank'}. You may not need a ride at all :-)

    What if I'm not registered?
  %p
    Thirteen states plus the District of Columbia offer same-day voter registration, allowing you to register and vote at the same time, on the day of the election. Learn where this is available, and the requirements, #{link_to 'here', 'http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx', target: '_blank'}

    Is it safe?

    %i
      Drive the Vote 
    requires a real identity, and uses Facebook login and a validated phone number and address to try to enforce that. You should communicate with potential drivers and riders prior to sharing a car, decline to enter or continue a ride if you feel uncomfortable, and exercise the same judgement as you would when buying something on Craigslist, or using a dating app.
