# Using the Dispatcher App
Each ride zone has a dispatch page with two main pieces: a map of all drivers and rides in progress, and a table with an overview of all active conversations. By clicking on a conversation, the dispatcher can read the thread, and text back directly to the voter from within the app.

Each dispatch page has a link to a page where volunteer drivers can sign up for that specific ride zone, and a shareable link to a page where voters can schedule rides for that RZ.

The dispatch app has a page with the names and contact information of all drivers, and a page showing a larger map view.
